**Word Counter** 📝  

 📌 **Project Overview**  
The **Word Counter** is a simple yet effective Python program that counts the number of words in a given text input (sentence or paragraph).  
This project helps in enhancing Python skills, including input handling, string manipulation, function creation, and error handling.


 🎯 **Features** 
 
✅ Accepts user input (sentence or paragraph)  
✅ Implements a function to count words efficiently  
✅ Displays the total word count as output  
✅ Handles errors like empty input  
✅ User-friendly interface with clear instructions  


🛠️ **How It Works**

The program prompts the user to enter text.

It processes the input and counts the words (separated by spaces).

The total word count is displayed.

If no input is given, it handles the error and asks for valid input.


🛡️ **Error Handling**

If the user enters empty input, the program displays an error message.

The program automatically trims extra spaces and only counts valid words.


🏗️ **Future Improvements**

🔹 Support for counting unique words

🔹 Advanced text analysis features like sentence count, readability score

🔹 GUI version using Tkinter or a web-based version
